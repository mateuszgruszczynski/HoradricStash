# Horadric Stash

This mod increases size of stash to 16x16 and replaces additional stash tabs with single "Craft" tab containing all runes, gems and materials.

Since v1.1.0 this mod should be R2DMM compatible but was not tested thoroughly.

**Warning: This mod requires "Reign of the Warlock" DLC**
